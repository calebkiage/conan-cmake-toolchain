# The following options fix issues with building on mingw.

# Newer package recipes (libsodium, libcurl) check for bash path before adding
# msys2/cci.latest
# This option prevents recipes from adding the msys2/cci.latest build_require.
# msys2/cci.latest which links libraries with msys-2.0.dll
# MinGW packages built for windows shouldn't link to the msys runtime.
# **Make sure the mingw build tools are in the path. If you need msys tools as
# **well (e.g. for auto-tools), add them after the mingw path.
